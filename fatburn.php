        <h3>FOOD SUPPLEMENTATION – WISELY!</h3>
        <p>OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES, THE RANGE OF AVAILABLE FOOD SUPPLEMENTS HAS BEEN ENTIRELY ALTERED.
        Twenty years ago there were only vitamin and mineral formulas, proteins, weight/mass gainers (full of sugar) and a handful of amino acid products on the market. It wasn’t particularly difficult for anyone to put together the suitable stack to meet all possible needs. Since then, the situation has changed substantially. The leading supplement companies supply tens or hundreds of different products. As a result, there are many things to take into consideration before choosing the best possible dietary supplement combination.
        The first step is to clarify what you are about to achieve!Secondly, you have to be clear about your current level of physical development and your budget constraints. It’s also advantageous to find out if you have any allergies to certain micro and macro nutrients or ingredients. As the name suggests, do not forget that dietary supplements supplement the diet. If your aims and your diet are incompatible, it’s practically impossible to achieve the goals you set. Similarly, you won’t get bigger and stronger muscles, a lower level of body fat or better endurance without proper physical training. Before starting a supplement program, it is strongly recommended to get some basic knowledge concerning nutrition and training theory and practice.</p>

    <h3>HE ONLY DRAWBACK OF LOSING WEIGHT</h3>
    <p>In case of body fat reduction it is increasingly true that without proper daily nutrition, all the world’s legal and illegal supplements won’t be enough to see a satisfying result. The main idea behind losing weight is to take fewer calories into our bodies than we actually use up.
Both calorie intake and calorie expenditure can be influenced by certain supplements. On the other hand, neutralising massive amounts of calorie surplus is impossible.</p>
